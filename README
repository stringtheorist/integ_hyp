This is a small library for the numerical evaluation of singular and
hypersingular integrals. The method used is that developed by Kolm, 
and Rokhlin of Yale University in their 2001 paper entitled 
"Numerical Quadratures for Singular and Hypersingular Ingetrals" published in 
the journal Computers and Mathematics with Applications in volume 41.
